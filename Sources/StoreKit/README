For the receipt validation to work:

1. You need a copy of Apple's Root Certificate included in your application bundle for local receipt validation to succeed. I wrote "Receipt Validation â€“ Verifying a Receipt Signature in Swift" to guide you through this process if you need help.
2. You need OpenSSL to be statically-linked to your project. I wrote "OpenSSL for iOS & Swift the Easy Way" to guide you through this process if you need help.
3. You need to include the following additional resources after OpenSSL is installed. Example implementations are provided in the demo project.
